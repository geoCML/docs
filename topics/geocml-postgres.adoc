geoCML deploys a micro-service container with a PostGIS enabled Postgres database by default for your project. This is the primary data store for a geoCML deployment.

=== Configuring geoCML Postgres

geoCML Postgres can be fully configured to suit the needs of your use case. geoCML Postgres has a two step configuration process: Dockerfile configuration, and Ansible configuration.

==== Docker Configuration

You can use Docker to install packages to your geoCML Postgres service deployment. Open geocml-base-deployment\Dockerfiles\Dockerfile.geocml-postgres in your favorite text editor, and between the Customize Container Here and End Customizations comments, add your use-case specific geocml-postgres configuration steps.

==== Ansible Configuration

You can use Ansible to automate advanced, tedious configuration workflows. By default, geoCML Postgres uses Ansible to automate configuring your database. You can further customize your advanced configurations. Open geocml-base-deployment/ansible-playbooks/geocml-postgres-playbook.yaml

=== Accessing your database

geoCML Postgres creates a database named geocml_db, which is the primary datastore for your geoCML project. _Do not change the name of this database!_ You can access your database in several ways:

- via geoCML Desktop and QGIS (over the internal geocml-network)
- via a PostgreSQL data explorer (over port {deployment host URL}:5432)

The default credentials for accessing your database are:

- Username: geocml
- Password: geocml

geoCML Postgres also configures an admin user for your data store. The default credentials for accessing your data store as an admin are:

- Username: postgres
- Password: admin

You can change the default password for both the geocml and postgres users in your deployment's `.env` file. Note that these are build-time arguments; you must rebuild your containers to commit these changes.

=== Current limitations of the geoCML Postgres service

In geoCML v0.3.0, there are known limitations with the geoCML Postgres service. Currently, geoCML Postgres does not support the following data:

- Raster datasets,
- Domain fields

If you are working with raster data, please store them in the persistence layer rather than in geoCML Postgres.
