DRGON (pronounced as 'Dragon') is a Distributed Registry of GISystems Over a Network. DRGON collects a registry geoCML deployments over the internet (or an intranet, if you prefer). Using a simple REST API, you can easily query DRGON to find the perfect dataset. A public registry is hosted at https://drgon.geocml.com, but you may also self host a DRGON instance, depending on your needs.

=== Quickstart Guide

Before interacting with DRGON, you must first have a hosted geoCML deployment with a properly configured geoCML Server Portal. Next, register for an API key via a POST request to <DRGON_HOST>/apikey; You must provide an email address in the request body. _Copy your API key to a safe place, you will only be able to view it once!_

On your deployment's server machine, add the following values to your `.env` file:

. DRGON_HOST: the host URL of the DRGON instance you want to use (Do not include trailing slash)
. DRGON_API_KEY: your DRGON API key
. GEOCML_DEPLOYMENT_HOST: the domain name of your hosted geoCML instance

Rebuild your geoCML deployment, and restart your instance. After about a minute of up-time, geoCML Task Scheduler will ping DRGON and automatically register your deployment.

=== Self Hosting a DRGON Instance

You can host your own dedicated DRGON instance with a few simple steps:

. Clone the geoCML source code from https://github.com/geocml/drgon[github.com/geocml/drgon]
. Open a terminal and cd into the source code directory
. Copy `.env.example` into a new file called `.env`
. Update your `.env` to include your deployment specific configuration variables
. Run `sh build.sh` to build DRGON service images on your machine.
. Run `docker network create drgon-network`
. Run `sh start.sh` to bring up the instance.

=== Moderating DRGON

Whoever hosts a DRGON instance is free to moderate their registry however they wish. DRGON automatically moderates deployments containing banned words (e.g. offensive words), however manual review and moderation of deployments in your registry is highly recommended.

The DRGON development team recommends that you prevent users from abusing your registry, either by uploading duplicate datasets, or by registering non-geoCML deployments. If a user is abusing your registry, you can revoke their API key within the `drgon-postgres` service database.
