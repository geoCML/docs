geoCML is a Containerized, Multi-paradigm, Lightweight deployment pattern for geographic information systems running locally or in the cloud. geoCML deployments package best-in-class open-source GIS software, including QGIS and PostGIS, allowing you to quickly go to production. In this topic, you will learn how geoCML deployments work and be able to make an informed decision about whether geoCML is a good choice your needs.

=== How does geoCML work?

geoCML deployments include four containerized microservices: geocml-desktop (the primary user entrypoint), geocml-server (the secondary user entrypoint), geocml-postgres (the primary data store), and geocml-task-scheduler (an automation service, often abbreviated as gTS). Each service can communicate via an internal network called geocml-network. Once deployed as a geoCML instance, you can begin using geoCML to complete GIS workflows. By design, each geoCML instance should host only one project/dataset. Multiple datasets should be hosted across multiple geoCML instances. Specific documentation on each service is available for your reference.

=== What can geoCML do?

geoCML deployments come out of the box with a variety of features:

- Desktop GIS workflows
- Cloud native server GIS workflows
- Routine database backups
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS database hosting
- Python support for writing custom gTS automation tasks
- Persist information between containerized services via the persistence-layer directory
- Realtime GIS
- Use less space/resources than other enterprise GIS deployments

=== What can geoCML _not_ do out of the box?

geoCML is currently limited in the following areas:

- Integration with ArcGIS proprietary deployments and extensions
- Database version management
- Backup domain values in a database
- Support for storing raster data in geocml-postgres
- MySQL support, SQL Server support, etc (base deployments only support PostgreSQL/PostGIS)

geoCML base deployments are customizable to fit your specific needs. You can customize your services however you'd like! If you would like to contribute to the development of geoCML, you can find the project on GitHub at https://github.com/geocml[github.com/geocml].

=== Using hosted geoCML images from GHCR

The geoCML development team hosts pre-built containers at our container registry on Github. These containers are a great way to demo geoCML, but please note that these services are _not production ready_, because they lack the required build arguments. If you want to use geoCML in production, please build your containers.

Please keep in mind that the GEOCML_DESKTOP_PASSWORD variable in the `.env` file must be set to access your deployment via geoCML Desktop.
