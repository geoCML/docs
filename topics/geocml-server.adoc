geoCML deploys a micro-service container with a QGIS Server instance, an Apache web server, and a React application called geoCML Server Portal (a frontend for your server GIS). This micro-service is responsible for implementing web and server GIS paradigms for your project. geoCML Server collects information from geocml-project.qgz to serve your data via several web services.

=== Configuring geoCML Server

geoCML Server can be fully configured to suit the needs of your use case. geoCML Server has a two step configuration process: Dockerfile configuration, and Ansible configuration.

==== Docker Configuration

You can use Docker to install packages to your geoCML Server service deployment. Open geocml-base-deployment\Dockerfiles\Dockerfile.geocml-server in your favorite text editor, and between the Customize Container Here and End Customizations comments, add your use-case specific geocml-server configuration steps.

==== Ansible Configuration

You can use Ansible to automate advanced, tedious configuration workflows. By default, geoCML Server uses Ansible to automate configuring your Apache and QGIS Server. You can further customize your advanced configurations. Open geocml-base-deployment/ansible-playbooks/geocml-server-playbook.yaml

=== Accessing geoCML Server via the web

geoCML Server Portal is accessible via {deployment host URL}:80. geoCML Server Portal is a web application frontend for geoCML Server written in React. geoCML Server Portal acts as the secondary user entrypoint for your deployment, allowing you to share data with others over the internet. geoCML Server Portal relies on Web Map Service (WMS) information from geocml-project.qgz in order to properly display your instance information.

geoCML Server Portal features:

- a description of your project,
- your contact information,
- copyright claims for your project's data,
- a hosted Leaflet web map,
- WMS connection information,
- WFS connection information,
- WCS connection information,
- a preview of your hosted data,
- a list of all hosted data tables,
- similar recommended datasets from DRGON

=== Accessing geoCML Server via an API

geoCML Server exposes all API functionality for QGIS Server via cfcgi and Apache. Learn more about QGIS Server here: https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/server_manual/index.html
