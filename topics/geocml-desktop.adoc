geoCML Desktop is the primary access point for your geoCML deployment. geoCML Desktop provides you with a desktop environment allowing you to prepare, visualize, and analyze your GIS data. The geocml-desktop container is based on Ubuntu Linux and comes installed with the XPRA, allowing you to view running applications in a web browser. geoCML Desktop comes preinstalled with https://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS], a best-in-class open-source 

=== Connecting to geoCML Desktop

After instantiating your geoCML deployment, you can connect to geoCML Desktop via a web browser at {deployment host URL}:10000.

=== Using geoCML Desktop

geoCML Desktop is designed to be a replacement for your typical desktop GIS experience. With the default geoCML Desktop, you can:

- Use QGIS to prepare, aggregate, and visualize your GIS data
- Configure geoCML Server Portal
- Connect to the geocml-postgres service

=== Configuring geoCML Desktop

You may want to extend the default geocml-desktop service with additional applications or configurations that meet your needs.
geoCML Destkop has a two step configuration process: Dockerfile configuration, and Ansible configuration.

==== Docker Configuration

You can use Docker to install packages to geoCML Desktop. Open geocml-base-deployment\Dockerfiles\Dockerfile.geocml-desktop in your favorite text editor, and between the Customize Container Here and End Customizations comments, add your use-case specific geoCML Desktop configuration steps.

==== Ansible Configuration

You can use Ansible to automate advanced, tedious configuration workflows. By default, geoCML Desktop uses Ansible to automate configuring your database. You can further customize your advanced configurations. Open geocml-base-deployment/ansible-playbooks/geocml-desktop-playbook.yaml

=== Understanding the persistence layer

geoCML deployments do not persist data; the file system within the service should not ever be changed directly unless during the build process. You may wonder how, then, are you to upload and change datasets contained within the geoCML Desktop service?

The persistence layer is a _mutible and persistent_ directory shared between the geoCML Desktop service and the deployment's host machine. geoCML Base Deployments use Docker to bind the host machine's local persistence layer to a persistence layer within the geoCML Desktop service. This binding allows you to add files to the host machine's persistence layer and have them available within the geoCML Desktop service. The persistence layer is also be available to other services within the deployment.


==== About geocml-project.qgz

geoCML Desktop will automatically open geocml-project.qgz in QGIS when you connect to the XPRA service. geocml-project.qgz is the central project file for your entire geoCML deployment. By design, all of your GIS work must be done in this file.


==== Typography and Fonts

geoCML Desktop comes with the following fonts installed by default:

- Baskerville
- EB Garamond
- Noto Serif
- Open Sans
- Oswald
- Roboto

You can install custom fonts to geoCML Desktop to support your needs when creating maps. Follow these steps to add new fonts:

1. Collect your custom font as a .ttf file.
2. Copy your font to the `Fonts/` directory in the persistence layer.
3. gTS will automatically refresh your font cache every minute. After a minute has passed, restart QGIS.


==== Installing QGIS Plugins

You can add workflow specific QGIS plugins to geoCML Desktop using the `qgis-plugin-manager` command line utility. Follow these steps to add new QGIS plugins to your geoCML Desktop instance:

1. In a text editor, open `build-resources/geocml-desktop/entrypoint.sh`.
2. Add the following line to the `entrypoint.sh` file: `qgis-plugin-manager install <NAME OF PLUGIN>`.
3. Run the install script to rebuild your containers.
