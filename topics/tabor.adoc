Tabor is a database modeling language for GIS based on YAML, but with additional syntax restrictions. The goal of Tabor is to allow GIS users to create and maintain complex database rules using plain-text configuration files. The following is an example of a Tabor configuration file for a PostGIS database:

```
tabor: 4.0
layers:

- name: grass
  schema: public
  owner: geocml
  geometry: polygon
  srid: 4326
  fields:
    - name: fid
      type: int
      pk: true

- name: trees
  schema: public
  owner: geocml
  geometry: point
  srid: 4326
  fields:
  - name: fid
    type: int
    pk: true
  - name: genus
    type: text
  - name: species
    type: text
  - name: height_meters
    type: numeric
  - name: circumference_cm
    type: numeric
  constraints:
    - name: on
      layer: grass

- name: streams
  schema: public
  owner: geocml
  geometry: polyline
  srid: 4326
  fields:
    - name: fid
      type: int
      pk: true
```

Running this file through the Tabor command line utility generates a valid PostgreSQL schema query that can be used to create or update tables in a PostGIS database.

=== Downloading and Installing Tabor

Tabor can be downloaded directly from https://github.com/geoCML/tabor. After downloading, simply extract the downloaded .zip file to a directory accessible on your terminal path.

=== Command Line Usage

`tabor read --file <path/to/file>` -> Converts a .tabor file into a PostGIS schema query.

`tabor write --file <path/to/file> --db <name_of_psql_db> --username <name of db user> --password <password of db user?> --host <host of psql db?> --port <port of psql db?> --ignore <tables to ignore?>` -> Converts a PostGIS database to a .tabor file

`tabor load --file <path/to/file> --db <name_of_psql_db> --username <name of db user> --password <password of db user?> --host <host of psql db?> --port <port of psql db?>` -> Loads a PostGIS database from a .tabor file.

=== Supported Geometry Types

Tabor supports the following geometry types:

- `polygon` -> for 2D shapes such as political boundaries
- `polyline` -> for 1D shapes such as roadway centerlines
- `point` -> for 1D shapes such as trees

If a layer has no geometry type, it may still be defined as a non-geometric table in the database.

The spatial reference of each layer in your Tabor file can be defined with the `srid` field, followed by the SRID of your reference system.

=== Supported Field Types

Tabor supports the following primitive field types:

- `int` -> for whole numbers
- `numeric` -> for decimal numbers
- `text` -> for unlimited length character strings
- `boolean` -> for true or false values

Tabor also supports arrays of primitive data. You can define an array as `type: <primitive> array`.

Tabor has support for several temporal data fields:

- `date` -> for date values
- `time` -> for time values
- `timestamp` -> for timestamp values

It is strongly recommended that you have a primary key (pk) on each of your layers. You can define a field as a primary key using `pk: true`.

=== Data Constraints

You can define complex business logic in your Tabor file with data constraints. Data constraints ensure that changes to your database table meets specific rules before they are committed to the database. You can choose to include as many data constraints on your layers as you need.

Tabor supports the following data constraints:

- `on` -> Checks that new features are at least partially within the boundaries of another layer (works with all geometry types)

ex.
```yaml
constraints:
  - name: on
    layer: other_layer
```

- `length` -> Checks that new polyline features have either a minimum or maximum length

ex.
```yaml
constraints:
  - name: length
    minimum: 0.5
    maximum: 99.5 # You must include either a minimum or maximum value, but not both!
```

- `near` -> Checks that new features are placed within a given distance of another layer (works with all geometry type)

ex.
```yaml
constraints:
  - name: near
    distance: 15.6
    layer: other_layer
```

=== Domain Values

Domain values are commonly used in GIS databases to apply specific constraints on fields. Tabor allows you to create domain values for use in your database schema.

ex.
```yaml
domains:
- name: _confidence
  type: text
  values:
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low

layers:
  - name: table_with_domain
    schema: public
    owner: postgres
    fields:
    - name: level_of_confidence
      type: _confidence
```

This example creates a domain value named `_confidence` which constrains a field to the following values: High, Medium, and Low. Note that the domain value begins with a `_` --this is a requirement for domain values in Tabor. You can use the domain value as a field type when defining a layer.
